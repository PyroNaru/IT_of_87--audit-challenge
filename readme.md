Frontend Code Audit & Refactor Challenge

Project Description:
This project is part of the Frontend Code Audit & Refactor Challenge.  
The goal of the activity is to analyze a broken frontend project, identify issues in HTML, CSS, file structure, and Git usage, then refactor the code.

Objectives:

- Audit existing frontend code
- Identify HTML, CSS, and structural issues
- Document findings in `AUDIT.md`

- Practice proper GitHub workflow and commits
- Improve project structure and responsiveness

Features:

Reflection:
This challenge helped us improve our ability to read and understand existing code, identify common frontend issues, and refactor as a group. We learned the importance of semantic HTML, responsive layouts, clean file structures, and clear documentation when working in a team environment.
